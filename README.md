A C++ implementation of the
[ThinMatrix OpenGL tutorials on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP).
The tutorials were originally written in Java, but and this is a fairly
straightforward port -- so if you see things that aren't necessarily idiomatic
C++, that's why.

This code requires OpenGL 3.3, SDL2 and glm.

As to why it's called jac... I don't know. Sorry.
